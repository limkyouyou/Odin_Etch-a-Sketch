Title: Odin Foundation Course Etch-a-Sketch Project

This is a project to practice my skill on CSS, HTML, and JavaScript that I've learned so far from the foundation course of the Odin Project.
The goal of the project is to build a Etch-a-Sketch with 16 x 16 grid, each grid squares changing its color when mouse cursor is hovered over it. 
The main focus of this project is to practice DOM manipulation using javaScript, therfore grid squares are created and styled from javaScript.
There is a button, when clicked, will prompt the user to enter a number of squares per side. Once entered, the existing grid is removed and a new grid is generated in the same total space as before. The maximum squares per side is capped at 100.
For extra credit, squares will change to a random color when mouse is hovered over them. Then the square will turn 10% more black everytime mouse is hovered over it, so after 10 passes, the square will become completely black.
